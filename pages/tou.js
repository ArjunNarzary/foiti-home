          <p>
            As between you and us, Foiti (and its licensors) is the owner of the
            Services, including all proprietary content, information, material,
            software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, trademarks,
            service marks, copyrights, photographs, and &quot;look and
            feel&quot; of the Services, and all related intellectual property
            rights. Foiti grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable,
            non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the
            Services. This license is for the sole purpose of using and enjoying
            the Services in a way that these Terms and our policies, such as our
            Community Guidelines allow. You may not use the Services in ways
            that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else
            in doing so.
          </p>
          <h1 className="font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Rights You Grant Us</h1>
          <p>
            Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive,
            and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership
            rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a
            license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on
            which Services you use.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            For all content you submit to the Services, you grant Foiti and our
            affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and
            transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce,
            modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyse, transmit, and distribute that
            content. This license is for the purpose of operating, developing,
            providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and
            developing new ones. This license includes a right for us to make
            your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service
            providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the
            provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing such
            Services.

          <p>
            If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we
            may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for
            example, if it infringes someone&apos;s intellectual property or
            impersonates another user).
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we
            have and make available in our Service, we retain all rights to our
            content (but not yours).

          <p>
            We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback
            or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating
            you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree
            that we will own all rights in any materials or items we develop
            based on such feedback or suggestions.

            Additional Terms for Specific Services

          <p>
            Additional terms and conditions listed on the Foiti Terms & Policies
            page or that are otherwise made available to you may apply to
            specific Services. If you use those Services, then those additional

            additional terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms
            will prevail while you are using the Services to which they apply.

            Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
          </h1>
          <p>
            We can remove any content or information that you share on the
            Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our
            policies (including our Community Guidelines) or we are permitted or
            required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing
            all or part of the Service to you immediately to protect our
            community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for
            us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our
            Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other
            people&apos;s intellectual property rights, or where we are
            permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or
            change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on
            our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we
            determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate
            adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe that your
            account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or
            permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you
            request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will
            automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may
            take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process
            begins. While the deletion process for such content is being
            undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but
            remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the
            content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove
            it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion
            or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              where your content has been used by others in accordance with this
              licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence
              will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
            </li>
            <li>
              where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical
              limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the
              deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
            </li>
            <li>
              where deletion would restrict our ability to:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our
                  terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate
                  misuse of our products or systems);

            </li>
            <li>
              in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is
              necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the
              exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

            If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall

            Foiti respects the rights of others. And so should you. You
            therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the

            believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you
            own or control, please report it using our in-app reporting feature.

            Modifying the Services and Termination
          </h1>
          <p>
            We&apos;re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones
            all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or
            functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services
            altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time for any
            reason, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice
            beforehand.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            While we hope you remain a lifelong Foiti user, you can terminate
            these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Foiti
            account.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            We may terminate or temporarily suspend your access to the Services
            if you fail to comply with these Terms, our Community Guidelines or
            the law, for any reason outside of our control, or for any reason,
            and without advanced notice. That means that we may terminate these
            Terms, stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or
            impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services.
            And while we&apos;ll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand,
            we can&apos;t guarantee that notice will be possible in all
            circumstances. For example, we may deactivate your account due to
            prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time
            for any reason.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Foiti
            continue to be bound by the Terms.
