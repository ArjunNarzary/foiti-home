          <h1 className="font-bold mt-5 mb-10 text-2xl">Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>
            When you use Foiti and the Services provided, you’ll share some
            information with us. So, we want to be upfront about the information
            we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls
            we give you to access, update, and delete your information.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve
            tried to write it in a way that’s easy to understand for all our
            users and blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these
            documents.
          </p>
          <h1 className="font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Information We Collect</h1>
          <p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p>
          <br></br>
          <ul className="font-bold">
            <li>Information you provide.</li>
            <li>Information we get when you use our services.</li>
            <li>Information we get from third parties.</li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories</p>
          <h1 className="font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Information You Provide</h1>
          <p>
            When you interact with our services, we collect information that you
            provide to us. For example, many of our services require you to set
            up an account, so we may need to collect a few important details
            about you, such as your name, username, password, email address,
            phone number, and date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us
            with some additional information that will be publicly visible on
            our services, such as a profile picture.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send
            through our services, such as messages. Keep in mind that the users
            who view your posts, message, and any other content can always save
            that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense
            that applies to the internet at large applies to our services as
            well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want
            someone to save or share.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any
            other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that
            we need to resolve your question.
          </p>

            Information We Get When You Use Our Services
          </h1>
          <p>
            When you use our services, we collect information about which of
            those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know,
            for instance, that you viewed a particular post, tapped on
            “Directions" and searched for particular place. Here’s a fuller
            explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our
            services:

                  and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a

            How Long We Keep Your Information
          </h1>
          <p>
            We store some information for longer periods of time. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We store your basic account information like your name, phone
              number, and email address and list of followers and following
              until you ask us to delete them.
            </li>
            <li>
              We store location information for different lengths of time based
              on how precise it is and which services you use..
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            If you ever decide to stop using Foiti, you delete it right from the
            app. We’ll also delete most of the information we’ve collected about
            you after you’ve been inactive for a while!
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our
            deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion
            will occur within a specific timeframe. There may be legal
            requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those
            deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to
            preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of
            Use violations, or if your account or content created by you is
            flagged by others or our systems for abuse or other Terms of Use
            violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in
            backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.

            Control Over Your Information
          </h1>
          <p>
            We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you
            with the following tools.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">
                Access, Correction, and Portability.
              </span>{" "}
              You can access and edit most of your basic account information
              right in our app. Because your privacy is important to us, we will
              ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information
              before we let you access or update your personal information. We
              may also reject your request to access or update your personal
              information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if
              the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.
            </li>
            <li>
              <spna className="font-bold">Revoking permissions.</spna> In most
              cases, if you let us use your information, you can simply revoke
              your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your
              device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do
              that, certain services may lose full functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Deletion.</span> While we hope you’ll
              remain a lifelong Foiti user, if for some reason you ever want to
              delete your account, you can delete it right from the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Communicating with other users.</span>{" "}
              It’s important to us that you stay in control over whom you
              communicate with. That’s why we’ve built a number of tools like to
              block another user from contacting you or seeing your posts.

            We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and
            store and process it in India and other countries outside of where
            you live. Whenever we share information outside of where you live,
            when we are legally required to do so, we make sure an adequate
            transfer mechanism is in place. We also make sure any third parties
            we share information with have an adequate transfer mechanism in
            place, as well.

            Our services are not intended for and we don’t direct them to anyone
            under 13. And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal
            information from anyone under 13. If we need to rely on consent as a
            legal basis for processing your information and your country
            requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent
            before we collect and use that information.

            Revisions to the Privacy Policy

            We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do,
            we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know
            by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s
            available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may
            provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to
            our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app
            notification).
